The changes you need to make are in two places:

1. **`mini-app/lib/metadata.ts`** – update the `title` and `description` exported values to match the new app description.  
2. **`mini-app/public/logo.png.todo`** – create this file to describe the logo that should be generated.

Please add `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` to the chat so I can propose the exact edits. Once that file is added, I’ll also provide a block to create `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo`.

A 2D animated character (cat, owl, dolphin, or dog) in a playful pose, wearing a small badge that indicates level. The background is a pastel gradient from light blue to light green, with faint symbols of hearts and stars to suggest mood tracking. The character is centered, with a friendly expression, and the overall style is cartoonish and vibrant.
